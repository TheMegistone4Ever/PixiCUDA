## 1. Getting Started

## 1.1 Deploying the Software

To deploy the motion blur filter application, follow these steps:

- Install CUDA Toolkit 12.2 or later from the [official NVIDIA website](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads).
- Install the latest version of [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/).
- Install the latest version of [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).										
- Build the OpenCV library from source with CUDA 12.2 or later support for Visual Studio you have installed. The 
  instructions for building OpenCV with CUDA support can be
  found [here](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d6/d15/tutorial_building_tegra_cuda.html).
- Create a new `CUDA 12.2 (or or later) Runtime` project in Visual Studio or another C++ environment and clone the
  PixiCUDA repository:

  `git clone https://github.com/TheMegistone4Ever/PixiCUDA.git`

- Open the project in Visual Studio.
- Edit path to images in [main.cpp](PixiCUDA/src/main.cpp) file.
- Build the project in Visual Studio into an executable (.exe) file.
- Run the application.														
- Select needed parameters. Application will create a new image with motion blur effect.
- Enjoy the result!

## 1.2 Purpose of Development

The development aims to provide users with a simple and fast way to apply motion blur effect to images using CUDA
acceleration. The application is designed to be user-friendly and easy to use. The application is intended for users
who want to apply motion blur effect to images with CUDA acceleration. It also providef usual CPU version of motion
blur filter for time comparison.
